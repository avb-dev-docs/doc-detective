This is specific test for Doc-Detective that can either be in JSON or inline markdown.  Doc Detective is doc content testing framework that makes it easy to keep your docs accurate and up-to-date. You write tests, and Doc Detective runs them directly against your product to make sure your docs match your user experience. Whether itâ€™s a UI-based process or a series of API calls, Doc Detective can help you find doc bugs before your users do.

Doc Detective ingests test specifications and text files, parses them for testable actions, then executes those actions in a browser. The results (PASS/FAIL and context) are output as a JSON object so that other pieces of infrastructure can parse and manipulate them as needed.

This project handles test parsing and web-based UI testing---it doesn't support results reporting or notifications. This framework is a part of testing infrastructures and needs to be complemented by other components.
